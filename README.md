# WITL

"We cannot tell you why the tram is late But surely can predict (sort of) its arrival"

## Getting Started

Flutter project aimed as a cross-platform extension of the [Native Android Version](https://github.com/LinlyBoi/WITL) of WITL.

Also includes actual usage of our [From Scratch API](https://github.com/LinlyBoi/witl-api) written in Rust and Docker-deployed.
